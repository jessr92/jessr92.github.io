      <h3>Week 3 - Your favourite colour</h3>
      <p>Week 3 of the photography challenge is "Your favourite colour". My favourite colour is blue. I was spoilt for choice when choosing a subject since we have lots of blue items.</p>
      <p>The subject I chose was our car - a 2nd generation Honda Jazz that Shantel named 'Gatsby'. We've had the car for just over a year and he's helped Shantel master the UK roads.</p>
      <p>The photograph is shown below. Apart from erasing our number plate, I added lots of background blur to make the car stand out.</p><img class="blog-image" src="/images/blog/photography_challenge_week_3.jpg" alt="A picture of our Honda Jazz, Gatsby, with lots of background blur">
